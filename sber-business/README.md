## 🔒 Security Architecture (Zero-Knowledge Vault)

1. **Hardware-Bound AES-256-GCM Encryption:**
   - All banking secrets (`client_id`, `client_secret`, access/refresh tokens, private RSA keys, and mTLS certificates) are encrypted at rest in a binary `.vault` file.
   - Master key is derived via HKDF (SHA-256) from the host's `/etc/machine-id` and a protected master key file (`0400` permissions).
   - Even if disk images or backups are stolen, credentials cannot be decrypted on another machine.
   - Plaintext `.env` files are completely disabled and disallowed.
2. **Ephemeral RAM-Only TLS & Clean CA Validation:**
   - Client certificates and private keys are materialized strictly in RAM (`/dev/shm`), set to `0600`, and securely wiped with null bytes (`\x00`) immediately after each HTTPS request.
   - All download and API requests validate server certificates against the official Ministry of Digital Development / Sber trust bundle (`--cacert trust_bundle.pem`).
3. **Local-Only Credential Ingestion & Process Safety:**
   - Credentials and certificates are never passed through chat transcripts or sent to LLM providers.
   - Certificates are decrypted using `openssl` with `-passin stdin` (passwords never appear in `/proc` process arguments).
   - Users run `python3 scripts/sber_vault.py setup` with masked console input (`getpass`).
4. **Anti-Leak Red Line:**
   - AI agents are strictly instructed never to expose raw secrets, tokens, or private keys in chat messages.

## 🛡️ Privacy & Compliance (Banking Secrecy)

- **Mandatory HTTPS:** All external webhook endpoints must use TLS (`https://`). Plain HTTP transmissions are rejected by the poller daemon.
- **Privacy Masking Option:** Set `"maskPrivacy": true` in `config.json` to mask sensitive account numbers (`40702...0000`) and tax IDs (`7707****93`) in broadcast messages.
- **Private Channels:** Users are instructed to deliver balance and transaction alerts exclusively to authenticated, restricted company channels.

## ⚡ Instant Multi-Channel Alerts (Faster than SMS)

The included daemon polls the bank's incremental statement endpoint (`/v2/statement/increment`) every 60 seconds and broadcasts incoming/outgoing transaction alerts in seconds:
- **0 ₽ Cost:** completely replaces paid SMS notification packages.
- **Rich Context:** displays full counterparty legal name, INN, bank BIC, clean payment purpose, and real-time closing balance with proper HTML escaping.
- **Supported Channels:**
  - **Telegram** (direct chat, group, or channel)
  - **MAX Messenger** (direct or corporate group)
  - **Discord** (incoming webhook)
  - **Slack / Mattermost** (incoming webhook)
  - **Custom Webhook** (strict HTTPS POST JSON payload for 1C/CRM integration)
